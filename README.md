# PSX-Stock-Market-Prediction-and-Analysis
A Final Year Project on Predicting Pakistan Stock Exchange using Time Series and Deep Learning. Financial Portfolio Optimization and Technical Analysis.

#### -> For prediction we are using 2 models ARIMA and LSTM to predict KSE ( 100, 30, and All ) Index.

#### -> Technical Analysis of historical data using Techincal indicators and Financial Portfolio Optmization using Efficient Frontier Markowitz.

#### -> Model Results and Accuracies are in relevant Jupyter Notebook.

#### -> We have a full working Application in Django that implements our whole project in BackEnd. 



### Abstract

A stock market plays an important role in a nation’s economic growth. It also reflects how
competently the publicly listed companies are performing. This project aims to analyze
the trends, investigate the factors influencing the stock prices and predict the upcoming
trends using different techniques of machine learning. Due to the random and uncer-
tain fluctuations in stocks prices, it is very difficult to understand its trends and make
predictions. Prediction of upcoming trend of a stock give us the opportunity to execute
purposes like automated trading and maintaining well performing stock in financial port-
folios. In this project we will analyze the historical data of KSE-100 index of PSX and
make a future prediction using different techniques of machine learning. Techniques of
machine learning are already implemented in the past to track the stock market trends but
with this project, we are aiming to improve the results with Time-Series analysis. Other
techniques of machine learning will also be implemented in the project to compare the
prediction results. Furthermore, we will also be handling anomalies which may cause
unusual fluctuations in stock prices. In addition, we will also perform technical analysis
on stock prices, so that a user can make better financial decisions and maintain a good
financial portfolio. In the second phase of our project, after implementing all the men-
tioned procedures, the final results were impressive. 

The Time-Series model(ARIMA) for KSE-100 index is 88% accurate in predicting next 493 observations
and the deep learning model(LSTM) has accuracy of 91% in predicting next 1256 observations. The portfolio
and technical analysis modules also gives us great deal of information such as volatility,
covariance, sharpe ratio, RSI, MACD and many other indicators which provides enough
information related to stock’s behaviour. With the mentioned results, we developed an
application, which will demonstrate all the mentioned modules. The application will help
the end user to better analyse the stock’s future behavior, manage financial portfolios,
observe technical indicators of a stock and make good financial decisions.
